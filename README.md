# FIRENZE HOUSING

## Static Front-End Website 

* This project was created for educational purposes within the scope of Code Institute's Diploma in Full Stack Software Developer course*

* Firenze Housing is a small company that offers quality and affordable rental apartments, rooms and storage services for students studying in Florence

* The purpose of this site is to market Firenze Housing's services to the user by providing easy-to-access, detailed and easy-to-understand information about the flat, room or storage service they are interested in

* This project requires the use of HTML and CSS, the core technologies I have learned so far

# Design

* A minimal color scheme and typography have been chosen to create a simple, eye-catching and impressive design

## Colour Scheme

* The two main colors in the logo design are used throughout the site to separate sections and objects from each other. The dark green color with #006161 hex code, which is called the Tropical Rain Forest, is densely used in the background and title text of the main sections. In addition, the colors of these illustrations have been adjusted accordingly in order to ensure that the illustrations in different sections are compatible with the page layout

* The second main color, #ff8749 hex coded Mango Tango, is mostly used to highlight the buttons. This choice was made because it is a more attractive color than the dark green color

* Black color is used in the general font and icons of the site

## Typography

* In order to have a simple design, two fonts are used. Syncopate was used for the main title and sub-titles, and Serif was used as its fallback. In order to attract attention to the main headings,underline decoration was applied. This is not implemented in the subheadings

* All remaining sections of the website (navigation menu, descriptions, etc.) use Yanone Kaffeesatz and Sans-serif as fallback font.

## Imagery

* The source of all images used on the website is [Unsplash](https://link-url-here.org).

* The imags have been carefully chosen to be compatible with the concept of the site. The main page image is a plain image in content in order to preserve the simplicity of the site

* The image of Ponte Vecchio, one of the most famous location of Florence, is used in the background of the About Us section

* In addition, the images used in the presentation of the rented apartments and rooms have been chosen to describe the service itself

## Icons and Illustrations

* All the icons in the services section and in the rental apartments and rooms section are selected from the free icons on the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) site

* All illustrations used in the Find Us section and the Storage service section of the site have been downloaded as PNG from the [Storyset](https://storyset.com/) site. Attribute is made to Storyset in the index.html file

## Logo and Favicon

* All logos on the site as well as the favicon in the browser bar are designed by me using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
