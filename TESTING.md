# Testing

## Code Validation

The website has been extensively tested.  All the HTML and CSS codes have been tested in the [W3C html Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). There was a minor bug in the contact.html file and it was easily fixed. Details are in the debugging section.
